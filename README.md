# 📚 Library on the Web

This web application demonstrates key concepts of Flask and its related modules.
It provides an interactive interface that displays a list of books, showing each book’s title, author, and rating.

Users can:

➕ Add a new book

🗑️ Delete an existing book

✏️ Edit the rating of any listed item

The application connects to a SQLite database using SQLAlchemy for ORM-based data handling.
Forms used in the Add and Edit features are validated using WTForms to ensure proper input handling.
